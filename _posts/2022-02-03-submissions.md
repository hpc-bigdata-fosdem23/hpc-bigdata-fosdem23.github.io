We invite presenters to submit talk proposals to present high-quality work with sufficient background
material to be clear to the HPC, Big Data, and/or Data Science communities.
Talk proposals should be submitted through the [FOSDEM Pentabarf
server](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22).
Submissions must include:

- Abstract (plain text, couple of paragraps)
- Session type
- Session length
- Expected prior knowledge / intended audience
- Speaker bio
- Links to code / slides / material for the talk (optional)
- Links to previous talks by the speaker

Our intention is to have a series of talks of about 20 minutes each, with an additional 5-10 minutes for questions by attendees.

We would also like to note:

- All accepted talks will be about (using) free and open source software.<br/>We highly discourage "marketing" talks.
- All talks will be given *in-person* at FOSDEM in Brussels, on Sunday 5 February 2023.<br/>
  <strong>Please take this into account when submitting your talk.</strong><br/>
  Remote presentations will unfortunately not be possible.
